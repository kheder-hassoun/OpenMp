# Project: Monte Carlo Area Approximation & Mandelbrot Set

This project contains two separate programs:

1. **First Question** (`firstq.c`): Approximates the area under the curve \( f(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \) using the Riemann sum method in parallel with OpenMP.
2. **Second Question** (`secondq.c`): Approximates the area of the Mandelbrot set using the Monte Carlo method with OpenMP and allows testing of sequential vs. parallel execution for performance comparison.

Both programs support profiling with `gprof` to analyze performance.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **GCC** (with OpenMP support)
- **GNU Make**
- **gprof**

## Instructions for First Question (`firstq.c`)

### How to Build and Run

1. **Build and Run with Profiling**:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```
   This command will:
   - Build the `firstq` program with profiling enabled.
   - Execute `firstq`, generating a profiling report in `gprof_report.txt`.

2. **Clean Up**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
   This removes all compiled files and profiling data.

3. **Profiling**:
   After running `make run`, you’ll find the profiling report in `gprof_report.txt`. This contains performance details generated by `gprof`.

### Example Output Files
- `gprof_report.txt`: Contains the profiling report for the execution of `firstq`.

## Instructions for Second Question (`secondq.c`)

The second question program uses OpenMP to approximate the Mandelbrot set area, supporting multi-threaded execution with varying thread counts. The Makefile is set up to automatically test `secondq` with multiple thread configurations and save the results.

### How to Build and Run

1. **Build and Run with Profiling**:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```
   This will:
   - Build `secondq` with profiling enabled.
   - Run `secondq` with thread counts of 1, 2, 4, and 8, saving each result to a separate output file (`results_1_thread.txt`, `results_2_threads.txt`, etc.).
   - Generate a `gprof_report.txt` file containing the profiling report.

2. **Clean Up**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
   This command removes all compiled files, generated results, and profiling data.

### Example Output Files
- `results_1_thread.txt`: Results when running with 1 thread.
- `results_2_threads.txt`: Results when running with 2 threads.
- `results_4_threads.txt`: Results when running with 4 threads.
- `results_8_threads.txt`: Results when running with 8 threads.
- `gprof_report.txt`: Contains the profiling report for the execution of `secondq`.

## Additional Notes

- **Performance Analysis**: By comparing the output times in each result file for `secondq`, you can observe the efficiency gains with different numbers of threads. The `gprof_report.txt` file provides detailed timing information to analyze bottlenecks and hotspots in each program.
- **Optimization**: Both programs are optimized with `-O2` for general performance improvements, but other levels may be used if more fine-tuning is required.
